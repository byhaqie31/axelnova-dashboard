# Motion System

Framer-grade motion for axelnovaventures.com. Every value below was tuned in the
"Axel Nova Landing" prototype — **do not re-tune ad hoc**. This doc is the single
source of truth for animation; [UI-STANDARDS.md](UI-STANDARDS.md) §8 defers here.

Brand feel: modern luxury, minimalist, weighted. Premium hotel lobby, not a video
game. Never bouncy (the single elastic ease is the magnetic-button release only),
never playful.

## Tokens — `app/utils/motion.ts`

Every animation must import from `MOTION`; no magic numbers in components.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `dur.fast` | 0.3s | Dashboard register, micro-interactions |
| `dur.base` | 0.6s | Standard entrances (hero badge) |
| `dur.slow` | 0.9s | Scroll reveals, hero subhead/CTAs |
| `dur.hero` | 1.2s | Signature moments |
| `ease.out` | `power3.out` | Default for everything |
| `ease.hero` | `expo.out` | Hero / signature moments only |
| `ease.inout` | `power2.inOut` | Page transitions |
| `ease.spring` | `elastic.out(1, 0.4)` | Magnetic-button release **only** |
| `ease.settle` | `power1.out` | Counters decelerating into a number |
| `stagger.tight` | 0.08 | Dashboard tiles |
| `stagger.base` | 0.1 | Cards, SplitText words |
| `stagger.loose` | 0.14 | Sparse layouts |
| `reveal.y` | 52px | Scroll-reveal travel |
| `reveal.start` | `top 85%` | Scroll-reveal trigger point |

Surfaces: the **marketing site** uses `base`–`hero`; **admin/portal dashboards**
use `fast`–0.5s (daily-use tools — counters shorten to ~0.9s, entrances to ~0.4s).
No parallax, no magnetic, no SplitText on dashboards.

## Plumbing

- `app/plugins/gsap.client.ts` registers ScrollTrigger + SplitText (free since
  GSAP 3.13), boots **Lenis** (`lerp: 0.1`) synced through GSAP's ticker with
  `lagSmoothing(0)` (required — without it Lenis stutters), and provides
  `$gsap / $ScrollTrigger / $SplitText / $lenis`.
- On `page:finish` it resets scroll **through Lenis** (`scrollTo(0, { immediate:
  true })` — native resets desync Lenis's internal position) and refreshes
  ScrollTrigger.
- Same-page anchor clicks (`a[href^="#"]`) are routed through
  `lenis.scrollTo(target, { duration: 1.1 })` — native anchor jumps bypass Lenis.
- `main.css` sets `html.lenis { scroll-behavior: auto }` — global
  `scroll-behavior: smooth` fights Lenis and breaks anchor jumps.
- Lenis is disabled entirely under `prefers-reduced-motion`. On touch devices
  Lenis 1.x leaves native momentum scrolling alone; verify on iOS before
  configuring `syncTouch`.
- `useMotion()` is the typed accessor for `$gsap` etc. plus the shared `reduced`
  flag. **Capture it at setup** — Nuxt context is unavailable inside event /
  `nextTick` / timer callbacks.

## Composables

All are client-guarded, kill their tweens/triggers on unmount, and no-op
(content fully visible) under reduced motion.

| Composable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `useScrollReveal(selector, options?)` | The standard `.reveal` API (unchanged signature). y: 52 → 0, 0.9s, `power3.out`, `top 85%`, once; small per-index delay cascades adjacent elements; `clearProps` on complete. |
| `useReveal(target, opts?)` | Ref- or selector-based reveal with group `stagger` (single trigger on the first element). Same token values. |
| `useSplitTextReveal(target, opts?)` | Signature headline: SplitText `type: 'words', mask: 'words'`, yPercent 110 → 0, 1.1s, `expo.out`, stagger 0.1. Returns `{ build }` — call inside `onMounted` to get the timeline for sequencing. Reverts the split after the entrance (resize-safe). |
| `useCountUp(target, end, opts?)` | Counts 0 → end on first view (`top 88%`, once), 1.8s (dashboard ~0.9s), `power1.out`, snapped to integers, written to `textContent`. Put `tabular-nums` on the element. SSR renders the real value; JS zeroes it post-hydration. Named `useCountUp` (not `useCounter`) to avoid colliding with VueUse's auto-imported `useCounter`. |
| `useParallaxImage(target)` | yPercent −5 → 5 scrubbed drift for media in an `overflow: hidden` mask sized 114% height / `top: -7%`. Desktop `pointer: fine` only. (No call sites yet — project cards have no imagery.) Named `useParallaxImage` (not `useParallax`) to avoid colliding with VueUse's auto-imported `useParallax`. |
| `useMagnetic(btnRef)` | Desktop-only magnetic CTA: button 0.3× cursor offset, inner `.magnetic-label` span 0.12×, `quickTo` 0.4s; release springs back 0.8s `elastic.out(1, 0.4)`. Adds `.is-magnetic` (drops the CSS transform transition). Wrap button contents in `<span class="magnetic-label">`. |

## Choreography (as built)

- **Hero** (`pages/public/index.vue`): badge 0.6s → headline SplitText 1.1s at
  `-=0.3` → subhead 0.9s at `-=0.55` → CTAs 0.9s at `-=0.7`. A ~3.5s safety
  timeout force-finishes the timeline (throttled/background tabs never run rAF).
  The gradient headline line gets per-word background mapping during the split —
  `background-clip: text` on an ancestor stops painting inside transformed
  descendants.
- **No preloader/curtain.** It delays content paint; LCP wins.
- **Stats row**: cells cascade (`useReveal` group, stagger 0.1), values count via
  `useCounter`.
- **SectionHeader**: 38×1.5px accent rule draws in `scaleX 0 → 1`, 0.9s, 0.2s
  delay, at `top 88%`.
- **Filter tabs**: one absolutely-positioned pill tweens x/width 0.45s to the
  active button; re-synced on resize **and `document.fonts.ready`** (font swap
  changes widths). Grid swap: out 0.22s / stagger 0.03 / `power2.in` → swap →
  in 0.5s / stagger 0.06 / `power3.out` + `clearProps`. Two prototype-proven
  rules: **kill the in-flight timeline on rapid clicks** (an `isAnimating`
  early-return drops inputs and strands cards invisible), and
  **`immediateRender: false` on the incoming `fromTo`** (otherwise visible cards
  flash out at build time).
- **Nav** (`layouts/public.vue`): tint + 48 → 44px shrink past 20px; hides
  (`translateY(-110%)`, 0.5s) on scroll-down past 160px with a 6px accumulator,
  reveals on any 4px scroll-up; never hides while the mobile drawer is open.
- **Page transitions** (`app.vue`): GSAP JS hooks, `out-in` — leave 0.3s
  `power2.in` (opacity, y −20), enter 0.45s `power3.out` (opacity, y 24 → 0).
- **ProjectCard**: CSS-only hover — −4px lift + glow (existing) + diagonal sheen
  sweep (`--sheen-color`, theme-aware).
- **Admin dashboard**: tiles stagger in on mount (y 16, 0.4s, stagger 0.08, once
  per navigation); metric counters ~0.9s when data arrives.

## Rules for new animations

1. **Use the tokens.** If a value isn't in `MOTION`, justify adding it there —
   never inline.
2. **Transform and opacity only** (counters animate a JS proxy). `will-change`
   sparingly, removed after. Never animate border/underline properties — draw
   underlines with a `scaleX` `::after` (`.link-underline`).
3. **Reveals run once.** Never scrub-reverse a reveal.
4. **`clearProps: 'opacity,transform'` after entrances** — leftover transforms
   break `position: sticky`/`fixed` descendants and hover transforms.
5. **Initial hidden states are set by GSAP only** — never `opacity-0` in
   CSS/classes. JS-off and SSR must paint full content (hero text stays in the
   SSR payload — no LCP regression).
6. **Reduced motion is a no-op, not a degraded copy**: entrances skipped, content
   instantly visible, Lenis off; essential state transitions kept.
7. **Cleanup**: every composable kills its tweens/ScrollTriggers on unmount and
   reverts SplitText — this is an SPA; leaked triggers corrupt scroll positions
   after navigation.
8. **One signature moment per page** (hero SplitText). Everything else supports
   quietly. If an animation doesn't add meaning, cut it.
9. **Mobile**: parallax + magnetic disabled on touch; reveals stay simple.
